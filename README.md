# EntityFrameworkCoreExamples

This repository is just for me to learn and play around with the functionalities of Entity Framework (Core)
All Examples are done with MySQL instead of MSSQL
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<b>Some general things to get started</b>

NuGet Packages needed:

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -> Basic Package for EF Core, installs some other Packages that it needs to work

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools -> Is required for the actions within the Package Manager Console like add migration etc.

Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -> Database provider for MySQL (not required when using MSSQL)

<b>Important:</b> Make sure that the Versions of these NuGet Packages are compatible to each other
<br><br><br>
Basic commands for the Package Manager Console:

add-migration {mirgation_name}

remove-mirgation {mirgation_name}

update-database
